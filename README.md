# Coffee Shop Sales Report

## Project Background
As a Data Analyst exploring sales trends in the retail coffee industry, I analysed transaction data from three fictitious NYC coffee shop locations: Astrovia, Hell's Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan. The dataset includes transaction details such as sales dates, times, quantities, store information, product categories, and revenue. The objective of this analysis was to uncover actionable insights into customer purchasing behaviour, product performance, and store-specific trends to optimise inventory, refine marketing strategies, and boost overall revenue generation.

## Executive Summary
This analysis provides insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance across three NYC coffee shops. Key findings include:
  - Overall Trends: Sales have shown a steady upward trend, with significantly higher sales on weekdays compared to weekends. The morning rush (8 am–10 am) is the busiest period.
  - Product Performance: Coffee dominates sales (39%), with Ethiopian and Brazilian coffees leading in popularity. However, items like espresso shots and dark chocolate underperform.
  - Store-Specific Trends: Each location exhibits unique customer preferences, such as Astrovia’s focus on Colombian coffee and Hell’s Kitchen’s demand for Brazilian coffee.
These findings serve as a foundation for targeted operational improvements, marketing campaigns, and customer satisfaction strategies.

## Recommendations
### 1. Optimise Operations for Peak Hours
Focus staffing and inventory during the morning rush (8 am–10 am) on peak days (Monday, Thursday, Friday) to meet demand effectively and enhance customer experience.
### 2. Promote or Remove Low-Performing Items
Launch promotions to improve sales of underperforming items such as espresso shots, Ouro Brasileiro shots, and dark chocolate.
If promotions fail, consider removing these items to streamline inventory.
### 3. Customise Offerings for Each Location
Tailor products and marketing to regional preferences:
  - Astrovia: Prioritise Colombian Medium Roast Coffee and Earl Grey Tea.
  - Hell’s Kitchen: Stock more Brazilian Coffee and Morning Sunrise Chai.
  - Lower Manhattan: Emphasise Ethiopian Coffee and Peppermint Tea.
### 4. Boost Weekend Sales
Introduce weekend-specific promotions, such as:
  - Bundle Offers: Coffee + croissant at a discounted price.
  - Double Loyalty Points: Reward customers for weekend purchases.
This strategy aims to increase foot traffic and revenue on slower weekend days.
### 5. Maximise Revenue from Bestsellers
Enhance marketing campaigns for Jamaican Coffee River, Morning Sunrise Chai, and Chili Mayan Chocolate to capitalise on their popularity and revenue potential.

## Assumptions and Caveats
  - Synthetic Dataset: The analysis is based on a fictitious dataset and may not reflect real-world conditions such as seasonality or regional competition.
  - Limited Customer Data: The dataset does not include customer demographics (e.g., age, income), which could provide additional insights for personalised marketing.
  - Product Trends: Preferences are based solely on transaction data and do not account for external factors like promotions or marketing campaigns.
